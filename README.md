## About the application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.
This application has no API connected to it. Currently only using mock-data.
The application allows searching for a specific movie by keyword or filtering movies by genre. Each movie has a detail page if the poster was to be clicked.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help
